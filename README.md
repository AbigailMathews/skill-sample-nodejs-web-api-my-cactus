## My Cactus Simulation Alexa Game

This is the repository for the my cactus simulation Alexa Game. This is an Alexa skill where players manage the light and watering of a cactus. They must check in frequently and keep the cactus alive and happy!

This skill uses the Alexa Web API for Games for 3D graphics on capable devices. The game is web-side authoritative and fully playable everywhere Alexa is, since it is a voice-driven experience.
